# linux_scripts

These are my Linux bash scripts I run to make my life easier. You are free to copy them if you wish.

# monitor_file

Some websites use avif images which are very unsupported in most applications. This script monitors a given folder (and its subfolders) for avif image downloads and then converts then converts them to png files.

Needs ffmpeg and inotify-tools to work.

# record_gpu

A way for me to easily use gpu-screen-recorder program on Linux. By binding this script to a hotkey I can turn the recording on and off and the script makes me files with unique filenames based on timestamp.


Gpu-screen-recorder is the fastest recording tool on Linux with minimal impact on system performance.
